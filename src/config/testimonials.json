            "testimonial": "On that occasion I want to provide that whoever necessary should be received my personal and special recommendation for Damián, who in the last year has been working with me as technical leader. I came to the Neoris in the beginning of 2017; and, immediately we created a team synergy. Damián took on the role of senior developer (TD) with success. He has proven himself to be a lifelong learner, with a willingness to embrace change and do every part of his job with the highest quality standards. He handled all our software corporate needs – from recruiting (technical interviewing) to organize a work team aligned, estimations and direct customer communication. Damián’s efforts and innovation also readied us for launching a highly successful project to Dreyfus Company. He was responsible of that successful team. This, I believe, is one of his greatest accomplishments. I am appreciative for the opportunity to have had Damián as a workmate, I recommend him for any position or career he chooses. Sincerely"
